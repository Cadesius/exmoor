            <p class="body-text">Ada Richards is pretty stoical. She'd been knocked over by a school bus two days before she was due to be recorded, but it hadn't occurred to her to cancel. She had even made a cake. Her parents were farmers and her mother took in visitors - Mr Usher among them. Her father lost a hand in a thrashing accident when she was young.</p>
            
            <p class="body-text">Her childhood memories are of helping on the farm, selling whortleberries in Lynton, breaking in Exmoor ponies, and falling asleep at school. At shearing time, she would take a jug of beer out to the men in the barn, who had arrived with their white suits strapped to their backs, and in the evening they'd have a singsong. She sings herself, but was too shy to join in at the time. Songs were more like stories then, she says. It was at a shearing party that she met her husband, John, whose family farmed above Porlock.</p>
